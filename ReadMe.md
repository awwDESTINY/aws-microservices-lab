# AWS Microservices & Cloud Architecting Project

This repository documents my AWS Cloud Architecting coursework (CS6620) and Capstone Lab project.  
It showcases the migration of a monolithic Node.js application into microservices and the deployment of a machine learning pipeline on AWS SageMaker.

## Contents
- **CS6620 Lab Project**: Migrated a monolithic Node.js app into microservices, deployed on ECS Fargate with Docker & CI/CD pipelines.
- **SageMaker Flight Delay Prediction**: Trained and optimized ML models using 580k+ flight records, deployed on AWS SageMaker.
- **AWS Skills Practiced**:
  - Amazon ECS (Fargate), ECR, RDS, Cloud9
  - AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, CodeDeploy
  - Application Load Balancer with path-based routing
  - Docker containerization
  - CloudWatch logging & monitoring
  - SageMaker for ML model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment

## Repository Structure
- `/docs`: Step-by-step documentation of each lab phase
- `Cs6620-Lab-Project.md`: Full write-up of the microservices migration project
- `SageMaker-Challenge-Report.md`: Detailed machine learning report
- `architecture-diagram.png`: High-level system architecture

## Highlight
This project demonstrates hands-on experience in **microservices, CI/CD pipelines, AWS cloud deployment, and machine learning workflows**, which align with industry practices for scalable AI-powered applications.
